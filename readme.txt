== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this theme require the Promptless WP plugin? =

No, the theme works without the plugin. However, for the best experience with automatic styling integration, we recommend using the Promptless WP plugin.

When using the Promptless WP plugin, colors are managed in the plugin's Global Settings. The theme automatically inherits these colors. Without the plugin, the theme uses sensible defaults.

Dark mode is enabled by default. Users can click the sun/moon icon in the header to toggle between light and dark mode. The theme also respects system preferences.

This theme is optimized for the Promptless WP page builder. It may work with other page builders, but full compatibility is not guaranteed.
